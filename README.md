# ProbeMaster Breakout Board 
This board is to make my life easier when measuring/probing unknown hardware.  Often I want to hook up a logic probe or DMM in to the crcuit 

and manipulate the outputs- hence the dipswitches so I can turn things on or off

The protoyping area will allow me to add any components INSIDE the working crcuit while measuring on the DUT- Handy eh?

You can add capacitance, resistance, switches LED indicators easily by putting them right in series or parell with the circuit

While the DIPswitch conenctions allow probing the lower connections are not joined in the center- this allows the user to either connect them or conenct with more components as mentioned above
